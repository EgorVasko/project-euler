'''
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
'''

a = 1
b = 2
c = 0
sum = 2
while a < 4000000 or b < 4000000 or c < 4000000:
    if c % 2 == 0:
        sum = sum + c
    c = a + b
    a = b
    b = c
print('By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, sum of the even-valued terms is:',sum)
